# serpfix

This is a Chrome extension that makes Google search result pages more
user-friendly.

It can hide text ads (which are often so numerous now that they push the first
organic result below the fold, sigh) and hide results from user-specified
domains.

The Google domains listed in `manifest.json` are from
<https://www.google.com/supported_domains>.
